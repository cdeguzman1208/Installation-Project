# Installation-Project
Create a prototype with plan for an **'Installation Art'** piece. It must be Interactive and Immersive. 

*As installation projects are larger undertakings that require advanced hardware, fabrication, and use of space, you are not required to create the full project for this weekly assignment. However, you are required to prototype some basic elements of it, as well as present your dream for a larger installation with ideas on how to achieve it.*

## Requirements
- Create a prototype that utilizes the environment in interesting ways. Input can include microphone, webcam, touch interface, buttons, or sensors. If you use mouse and keyboard, please describe ways to make this input more immersive in the description below. 
- Additionally, write a description of your planned production, including:
  - A description of the ideal environment for your project. If this was to be installed somewhere permanently, what is the intended space? Photos or real world locations or sketches of the intended setup are encouraged!
  - A list of preferred hardware to make this ideal solution possible. What input sensors would you need? What screen formats? As best as you can estimate, how much would this installation cost to produce? (Note: the most expensive solutions are not always the best ones. Budget should be part of your consideration for an ideal solution)
  - A description on how you could make this immersive. Looking at examples such as Meow WolfLinks to an external site.,  teamLabLinks to an external site.,  and moreLinks to an external site. - what type of Set Dressing could you use to make your installation more immersive?
